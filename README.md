# Deepfake-detection-project
Deepfake detection identifies manipulated or synthetic media content using machine learning algorithms and computer vision techniques to detect anomalies in facial and body movements and other visual artifacts.

In this kit, we build a Deepfake Detection Engine using the popular Facenet_pytorch, a Python library that implements deep learning models for face recognition tasks. It includes pre-trained models such as

MTCNN (Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Networks) for face detection and alignment, and
InceptionResnetV1 for detecting whether an image is fake or real.

We use these two models to detect and recognize faces in images with high accuracy. The library is built on top of PyTorch, a popular open-source machine learning framework, and provides an easy-to-use API for face recognition tasks.
