# Deepfake-detection-project
Deepfake detection involves machine learning algorithms and computer vision techniques to identify manipulated or synthetic media content. Deep fake detection aims to distinguish between genuine and altered content by analyzing facial and body movements and detecting visual artifacts.

To develop a Deepfake Detection Engine, we leverage the Facenet_pytorch library, a Python tool that offers deep learning models specifically designed for face recognition tasks. This library incorporates pre-trained models, including:

MTCNN (Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Networks): MTCNN facilitates face detection and alignment within images. It accurately locates faces and ensures they are correctly aligned for subsequent analysis.
InceptionResnetV1: This model enables the identification of whether an image is genuine or fake. It analyzes various features and characteristics to determine the authenticity of the image.
By utilizing these models, our Deepfake Detection Engine can effectively detect and recognize faces within images with remarkable precision. Facenet_pytorch is constructed on the PyTorch framework, a widely-used open-source machine learning platform, providing a user-friendly API that simplifies face recognition tasks.
